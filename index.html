                    <p>The first one is the Taj Mahal. It is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. It is also counted among the wonders of the world. It is made of white marble and looks even more beautiful at night when moonlight falls on it. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It took 22 years to build, and approximately 20,000 craftsmen and laborers worked on it. It is also believed that the hands of the craftsmen and laborers were cut off by Emperor Shah Jahan so that no one could build another similar structure.

                    <p>The second religious place is the Golden Temple. It is the most sacred shrine of the Sikhs. It was built by the 5th Guru, Shri Guru Arjan Dev Ji. Its foundation was laid by Sufi Saint Mian Mir Ji. The Golden Temple has four doors, meaning it is open to travelers from all four sides. It is situated in the middle of the Sarovar (holy pool). There is Akal Takht, which faces the west side of the Golden Temple. People of different religions, castes, and creeds visit it in millions every year. They bathe in the holy Sarovar, bow before the Shri Guru Granth Sahib, listen to Kirtan, and also eat Langar.

                    <p>The third monument is Hawa Mahal. It is also one of the most popular places in India. It is situated in the Pink City of Jaipur, Rajasthan. This building is made of pink and red sandstone. It was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh around 1799. It has five stories, and it is unbelievable that it has no foundation. It has 953 windows and looks very beautiful. It was designed by architect Lal Chand and resembles a beehive. It is known as the "Palace of Winds." It was built for the queens and other ladies of the Maharaja's family. From this building, the above-mentioned ladies could watch the festive programs because they were not allowed to go out in public.
