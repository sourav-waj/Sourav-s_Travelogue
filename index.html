                    <p>The first one is the Taj Mahal. It is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. It is also counted among the wonders of the world. It is made of white marble and looks even more beautiful at night when moonlight falls on it. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It took 22 years to build, and approximately 20,000 craftsmen and laborers worked on it. It is also believed that the hands of the craftsmen and laborers were cut off by Emperor Shah Jahan so that no one could build another similar structure.
